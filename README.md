# EEPROM programmer client

This is my version of the client code for Kris Adcock's Arduino Mega based EEPROM programmer (<http://danceswithferrets.org/geekblog/?page_id=903)>

His arduino firmware it relies on is at <https://github.com/oddblk/eeprom-writer>

This python code was inspired by his C++ client at <https://github.com/oddblk/eeprommer>
